\arguments{
\item{Pred_type}{the predictor type; choose between continuous or SNP}

\item{J}{the number of predictors. J should be at least 300.}

\item{K}{the number of studies.}

\item{level}{the level of heterogeneity. "l" stands for low, "m" stands for medium, and "h" stands for high.}

\item{rho}{a number between 0 and 1. controlling the degree of correlation between predictors}

\item{sigma}{a positive number. controlling the added noise to the simulated response variable}

\item{nlower}{the lower bound of the K sample sizes}

\item{nupper}{the upper bound of the K sample sizes}
}
\value{

\item{x}{an n x J matrix containing simulated predictors}
\item{y}{an n-length vector of simulated response variable}
\item{sid}{an n-length vector of integers containing the study id for each observation in data}
