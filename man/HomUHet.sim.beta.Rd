\usage{
HomUHet.sim.beta(
  J,
  K,
  homo_coef,
  heter_distr = c("Gaussian", "Uniform"),
  heter_coef_param = rbind(c(1, 2, 3), c(2, 1, 2), c(2, 2, 3))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{J}{The total number of predictors including the predictors with homogeneous and heterogeneous effects and the predictors without effects}

\item{K}{The number of studies}

\item{homo_coef}{the 2 x p1 input matrix to generate homogeneous coefficients of p1 number of predictors.
The first row should be integers indicating which columns the user wants the homogeneous coefficients to be.
The second row should be the homogeneous coefficients themselves}

\item{heter_distr}{indicates which distribution the user wishes to use to generate the heterogeneous coefficients}

\item{heter_coef_param}{the 3 x p2 input matrix to generate heterogeneous coefficients of p2 number of predictors.
The first row should be integers indicating which columns the user wants the heterogeneous coefficients to be.
If heter_distr="Gaussian", the second and third row for each column are, resepctively, the mean and standard deviation of the gaussian distribution used as heter_distr.
If heter_distr="Uniform", the second and third row for each column are, respectively, the lower boundary and upper boundary of the uniform distribution used as heter_distr.}
}
\value{
the simulated coefficient matrix and miscellenance information about it
\item{beta}{the K x J coefficient matrix}
\item{J}{the number of predictors including both predictors which have effects and which do not}
\item{K}{the number of studies}
\item{homo_index}{a vector containing the column numbers of homogeneous coefficients in the coefficient matrix}
\item{heter_index}{a vector containing the column numbers of homogeneous coefficients in the coefficient matrix}
}
\description{
this function outputs matrix of coefficients of all predictors (homogeneous or heterogeneous, or 0 in the case when the corresponding predictor has no effect)
and organize them as desired by the user
