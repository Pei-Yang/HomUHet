HomUHet                 fit a two-step penalized regression model
HomUHet-package         identify homogeneous and heterogeneous effects
                        of predictors in multiple datasets
HomUHet.plot            Plot the solution path from HomUHet
HomUHet.sim             simulate multiple data sets with both
                        homogeneous and heterogeneous effects from the
                        predictors
