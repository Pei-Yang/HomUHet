}
\arguments{
\item{J}{The total number of predictors including the predictors with homogeneous and heterogeneous effects and the predictors without effects}

\item{K}{The number of studies}

\item{n_homo}{the number of homogeneous coefficients}

\item{n_heter}{the number of heterogeneous coefficients}

\item{param_homo}{the two parameters of the uniform distribution used to simulate the homogeneous coefficients}

\item{param_heter}{the two parameters of the uniform distribution used to simulate the heterogeneous coefficients}

\item{example}{provides some examples of coefficient matrix for various number of studies (4 or 10) and levels of heterogeneity.
enter the level of heterogeneity in the first entry. "l", "m", and "h" represent the level of heterogeneity in coefficients
enter the number of studies in the second entry. 4 or 10.
where "l" stands for low, "m" stands for medium and "h" stands for high.}
