\arguments{
\item{J}{the total number of predictors.}

\item{K}{the number of studies.}

\item{param_age}{should be a vector containing the mean of age, followed by the standard deviation.}

\item{param_sex}{should be a number between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of one sex}

\item{n_cont}{the number of continuous predictors. 0 if there will be no continuous predictors}

\item{n_SNP}{the number of SNP predictors. 0 if there will be no SNP predictors}

\item{allele_freq}{a vector of length n_SNP containing the allele frequencies for the SNPs.}

\item{beta}{the K x J coefficient matrix}

\item{rho}{a number between 0 and 1. controlling the degree of correlation between predictors}

\item{sigma}{a positive number. controlling the added noise to the simulated response variable}

\item{nlower}{the lower bound of the K sample sizes}

\item{nupper}{the upper bound of the K sample sizes}
